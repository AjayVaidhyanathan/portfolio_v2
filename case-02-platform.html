      <div class="cs-section-label">The situation</div>

      <p>The company had grown through acquisition and organic expansion. The result: three overlapping tools doing
        roughly the same job, three separate contracts, and an internal team that had learned to hate all of them
        equally.</p>
      <p>Engineering wanted to consolidate. Finance wanted the savings. But nobody had made a compelling, board-ready
        case — and without that, nothing would move.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="cs-section">
      <div class="cs-section-label">My role</div>

      <p>I was asked to own the business case end-to-end: the analysis, the stakeholder alignment, the written document,
        and the board presentation. I had six weeks and a part-time data analyst.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="cs-section">
      <div class="cs-section-label">The approach</div>

      <p>I started by mapping the actual cost of the status quo — not just the contract values, but the hidden costs:
        engineering time spent maintaining three integrations, support load from users context-switching between tools,
        and the opportunity cost of not having a single source of truth.</p>
      <div class="callout">
        <p><strong>The hidden cost was bigger than the contracts.</strong> License costs were $340K/year combined. But
          when we added engineering overhead, support time, and duplicated data management, the true annual cost was
          closer to $890K.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="cs-list">
        <div class="cs-list-item"><span class="cs-list-n">01</span>
          <div><strong>Cost analysis.</strong> Full TCO for the current state, including soft costs. This reframed the
            investment from "we want to spend $2M" to "we're currently losing $890K/year staying still."</div>
        </div>
        <div class="cs-list-item"><span class="cs-list-n">02</span>
          <div><strong>ROI model.</strong> Conservative, base, and optimistic scenarios. I used the conservative case in
            all presentations to build credibility.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="cs-list-item"><span class="cs-list-n">03</span>
          <div><strong>Risk register.</strong> Identified the top 5 risks (migration data loss, user adoption, vendor
            lock-in, timeline overrun, integration failure) and mitigation for each.</div>

      <p>Before the board presentation, I ran three rounds of stakeholder reviews: engineering leads, finance, and the
        heads of the two main user teams. Each session surfaced objections that I incorporated into the document. By the
        time the board saw it, the key internal stakeholders were already aligned.</p>

      <div class="cs-section-label">What I learned</div>

      <p>Business cases fail for two reasons: they're not credible (the numbers look made up) or they're not aligned
        (someone important was surprised in the room). I've found that doing the alignment work first — even before you
        have all the numbers — makes the case stronger because you're incorporating real objections, not anticipating
        hypothetical ones.</p>
      <p>Using the conservative scenario as my headline number was a deliberate choice. It invited scrutiny rather than
        avoiding it, and it meant every challenge in the room was one I'd already addressed in the document.</p>
