    <!-- THE CLIENT -->
    <div class="cs-section">
      <div class="cs-section-label">The client</div>
      <p>Priya Foods Distribution Pvt. Ltd. is a fictional regional distributor of meat, poultry, seafood, and frozen
        processed foods based in Madurai, Tamil Nadu. They supply 140+ hotels, supermarkets, and restaurants across
        southern Tamil Nadu from a 1,200 m² warehouse operating 24 hours a day.</p>
      <p>At any given time, approximately ₹42 lakhs of perishable stock sits across 4 refrigerated rooms (2°C–8°C) and 2
        deep freezers (−18°C to −22°C). Every degree of temperature exceedance is a direct financial risk. The margin
        between "safe" and "condemned" is measured in minutes, not hours.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- THE SITUATION -->
    <div class="cs-section">
      <div class="cs-section-label">The situation</div>
      <p>Cold chain operations are unforgiving. A refrigeration failure at 2 AM that goes undetected until the morning
        inspection is not a minor inconvenience. It is stock destruction. Priya Foods had built their operations around
        three assumptions that were quietly failing them: that someone would notice a failure quickly, that two
        temperature logs a day was enough for compliance, and that staff awareness alone would keep doors properly
        sealed.</p>

      <div class="pain-grid">

            room, and start it manually. Deep freezers begin losing product integrity after 20 minutes.<sup>*</sup></p>

          <span class="pain-label">Door-ajar events/month</span>
          <span class="pain-n">~15</span>

        <p>"We knew something had gone wrong when the morning shift arrived. By then the damage was already done. There
          was no way to know sooner."</p>
      </div>

      <p>The real issue was that the operation had no <strong>continuous signal</strong>. Temperature data existed in a
        notebook twice a day. A power failure was only detectable if someone happened to notice the lights go out. The
        cold chain, the single most critical thing keeping the business running, was effectively unmonitored between
        manual checks.</p>

      <div class="callout">
        <p><sup>*</sup> <strong>How we quantified the cost:</strong> a deep freezer at -20°C with the compressor off
          rises roughly 0.4°C per minute in a closed unit under Tamil Nadu ambient conditions (around 30°C outside). The
          safe threshold is -18°C. That's about a 5-minute window before breach, and product quality starts degrading at
          -12°C (minute 20). Modelling ₹6 lakhs of stock per unit against that degradation curve gives an estimated
          ₹10,000-₹12,000 loss per minute in a full failure. Total annual loss before ColdGuard was estimated at ₹21+
          lakhs across power events, door incidents, compliance admin, and penalty risk.</p>

    <!-- THE SOLUTION -->
    <div class="cs-section">
      <div class="cs-section-label">The solution</div>
      <p>ColdGuard is an IoT monitoring and alerting system built in partnership with NexSense IoT Solutions
        (fictional), a Chennai-based industrial IoT integrator. It monitors temperature, humidity, door seal status, and
        three-phase power on every unit, every 60 seconds, and gets an alert to the on-duty technician's phone within 90
        seconds of a sustained breach.</p>
      <p>The thinking behind it was simple: close every gap in the continuous signal. If the data is there, the problem
        gets caught before it becomes a loss event. The alert, the response, and the FSSAI log are all just downstream
        of having reliable data flowing without interruption.</p>

        <p><strong>A key resilience decision:</strong> the Raspberry Pi gateway runs the alert logic locally, not just
          in the cloud. If AWS connectivity drops, the gateway keeps logging to SQLite and fires local alerts over the
          on-premise network. The cold chain stays protected even when the internet doesn't. This came from a real
          concern the client raised early: they didn't want to swap a manual single point of failure for a

    <!-- DATABASE -->
    <div class="cs-section">
      <div class="cs-section-label">Database strategy</div>
      <p>The overarching storage architecture relies on a specialized approach: standard PostgreSQL handles the
        relational data (user accounts, alert rules, unit metadata), while TimescaleDB—a PostgreSQL extension—processes
        the massive influx of time-series sensor data.</p>

      <p><strong>The Storage Challenge</strong><br>
        The primary hurdle in monitoring 7 units every minute is data volume: 10,080 rows a day, aggregating to over 3.7
        million rows annually. TimescaleDB elegantly handles this through automatic time-based partitioning (chunking).
        By organizing data into 7-day intervals behind the scenes, queries remain remarkably fast. Older data is managed
        via compression policies after 30 days (reducing spatial footprint by ~90%), and automatically deleted after a
        3-year compliance retention period.</p>

      <p><strong>The Export and Reporting Challenge</strong><br>
        A key requirement was generating the FSSAI compliance report automatically at midnight. Calculating min/max
        temperatures and compliance percentages across millions of rows can easily lock up a standard database. By
        utilizing database read replicas and pre-calculated hourly roll-up tables, the nightly export completes in
        seconds without interrupting the 30-second live dashboard refresh cycle used by operations.</p>

      <p><strong>IoT Threshold Alerting</strong><br>
        A distinct problem in IoT monitoring is that sensor data is inherently noisy. If an alert simply triggers when a
        temperature reading falls below or spikes above a threshold, normal warehouse operations (like briefly opening a
        freezer door to load stock) would flood technicians with false alarms. To combat this, the alert engine queries
        the TimescaleDB for continuous, rolling windows. A notification only fires if the temperature consistently
        breaches the threshold for a sustained period (e.g., 5-10 minutes), filtering out hardware glitches and brief
        drops, ensuring that when an alert does send, it represents a verified loss of temperature control.</p>

    <!-- PROBLEMS WE RAN INTO -->
    <div class="cs-section">
      <div class="cs-section-label">Problems we ran into</div>
      <p>Building on top of physical hardware means the real world pushes back in ways a purely software project
        doesn't. These were not edge cases we planned for. They were things we hit in practice and had to work through.
      </p>

      <div class="cs-list">
        <div class="cs-list-item">
          <span class="cs-list-n">01</span>
          <div><strong>Dirty and missing sensor data.</strong> Sensors occasionally sent malformed payloads: truncated
            JSON, null values where a temperature reading should be, or timestamps that were clearly wrong. Early on we
            were writing these straight to the database, which meant the compliance report would sometimes show
            impossible values like 0.00°C on a freezer running at -20°C. We had to build a validation layer on the
            ingestion side that flagged bad readings, stored them separately with a quality marker, and excluded them
            from compliance calculations without dropping them entirely. They still needed to exist for audit purposes.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="cs-list-item">
          <span class="cs-list-n">02</span>
          <div><strong>Sensors going offline mid-operation.</strong> A few ESP32 units lost Wi-Fi connectivity
            intermittently, usually during the peak heat of the afternoon when the warehouse was busiest. The gap in
            readings looked exactly like a sensor that had been physically damaged or switched off. We had to
            distinguish between "sensor is offline" and "sensor is reading something it shouldn't" because the response
            is completely different. One is a maintenance issue. The other is an emergency. We ended up adding a
            heartbeat check separate from the temperature readings, so the system could flag an offline sensor without
            triggering a cold chain alert.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="cs-list-item">
          <span class="cs-list-n">03</span>
          <div><strong>Secure transmission was harder than expected.</strong> Sending sensor data over the local Wi-Fi
            to the gateway was fine. Getting it securely from the gateway to AWS IoT Core required device certificates,
            mutual TLS, and a proper certificate rotation process. In a SaaS product you'd handle this once. Here every
            physical device in the warehouse needed its own certificate, and if one expired silently the unit would stop
            reporting without any obvious error. We had to build certificate expiry monitoring into the system, which
            was not in the original spec.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="cs-list-item">
          <span class="cs-list-n">04</span>
          <div><strong>Handling data volume at the query layer.</strong> The numbers sounded manageable in planning.
            10,080 rows a day felt fine. But once we had a few months of data across 7 units, some of the dashboard
            queries started slowing down noticeably, especially the trend charts that were scanning large time ranges.
            TimescaleDB's chunking solved most of it, but we also had to add a pre-aggregated hourly rollup table so the
            30-day chart wasn't recalculating from raw readings on every page load. That was a structural change we
            hadn't anticipated needing so soon.</div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="callout">
        <p>None of these were blockers, but all of them added time and changed what we shipped in v1 versus what came
          later. The data quality work in particular was something we underestimated. Clean data sounds obvious. Getting
          it in practice, from hardware that occasionally misbehaves, in a warehouse that runs 24 hours a day, takes
          more thought than the happy path suggests.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- WHAT I LEARNED -->
    <div class="cs-section">
      <div class="cs-section-label">What I learned</div>
      <p>The most important product decision on this project happened before any requirement was written. We had to
        agree on what "failure" actually meant. The client came in wanting to monitor temperature. What they really
        needed was to <strong>close every gap in the continuous signal</strong>. That reframe changed the scope
        significantly and is what brought power monitoring and ATS integration in from day one rather than as an
        afterthought.</p>
      <p>The 10-minute alert rule is a good example of where product thinking and technical thinking had to be in the
        same room. A simple implementation fires an alert the moment temperature crosses a threshold. In practice, that
        creates constant noise every time someone opens a door during normal loading, and the technician stops paying
        attention within a week. Getting the rule right meant understanding what actually happens on the floor, not just
        what the data model looks like.</p>
      <p>The local resilience architecture was the hardest sell. Running alert logic on the edge gateway added
        complexity and cost, and it was a difficult conversation to justify. But the alternative was a system that could
        fail to protect stock at the exact moment the internet went down during a power event, which is precisely when
        it was needed most. Some technical decisions are really trust decisions. If the people relying on a system don't
        believe it will work when things go wrong, they won't rely on it when things go right either.</p>
