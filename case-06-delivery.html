      <div class="cs-section-label">The situation</div>

      <p>The team was shipping every 6 weeks on a good month. Sometimes 8. Stakeholders were frustrated. Engineers were
        demoralised by the gap between when something was "done" and when users could actually use it. And we were
        consistently losing the ability to respond quickly to what we were learning post-launch.</p>
      <p>This wasn't a resources problem. The team was capable. Something in the process was creating drag.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="cs-section">
      <div class="cs-section-label">The diagnosis</div>

      <p>I spent two weeks shadowing the process rather than prescribing solutions. I sat in on sprint planning, spec
        reviews, and handoffs. I talked to engineers, designers, and QA about where they felt stuck.</p>
      <p>Three bottlenecks emerged:</p>
      <div class="cs-list">
        <div class="cs-list-item"><span class="cs-list-n">01</span>
          <div><strong>Specs were being written too late.</strong> Engineers were starting to estimate work before the
            spec was finalised, leading to re-scoping mid-sprint that rippled through the timeline.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="cs-list-item"><span class="cs-list-n">02</span>
          <div><strong>Review cycles had no time-box.</strong> Stakeholder feedback rounds had no defined endpoint, so
            they stayed open until someone escalated. Average: 8 business days per round.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="cs-list-item"><span class="cs-list-n">03</span>
          <div><strong>QA was sequential, not parallel.</strong> Testing only began after engineering signed off, which
            meant defects discovered late caused timeline overruns rather than priority reprioritisation.</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

      <div class="cs-section-label">What we changed</div>

      <div class="pullquote">
        <p>"We didn't need more people. We needed cleaner handoffs and shorter feedback loops."</p>
      </div>
      <div class="cs-list">
        <div class="cs-list-item"><span class="cs-list-n">01</span>
          <div><strong>Introduced a spec-ready gate.</strong> Work doesn't enter sprint planning until the spec has been
            reviewed and signed off by engineering lead and design. This pushed spec work earlier and reduced mid-sprint
            pivots by ~70%.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="cs-list-item"><span class="cs-list-n">02</span>
          <div><strong>Time-boxed stakeholder reviews to 3 business days.</strong> Feedback received after the window is
            logged for the next iteration, not incorporated into the current one. This was the hardest change to
            socialise — and the one that made the biggest difference.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="cs-list-item"><span class="cs-list-n">03</span>
          <div><strong>Shifted QA to run in parallel.</strong> QA begins testing completed components as they're merged,
            not waiting for full feature completion. This surfaced defects earlier and reduced end-of-sprint crunch
            significantly.</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="cs-section">
      <div class="cs-section-label">The rollout</div>

      <p>I introduced the changes incrementally over 6 weeks so we could isolate what was working. The spec-ready gate
        went in first, followed by the time-boxed reviews, then the QA process change. Each change had a defined owner
        and a retrospective checkpoint after the first two sprints.</p>
      <div class="callout">
        <p><strong>The hardest part wasn't the process.</strong> It was getting stakeholders comfortable with the idea
          that feedback arriving late would wait for the next cycle. Framing it as "your feedback will always be heard —
          just in the right sprint" helped significantly.</p>

      <div class="cs-section-label">What I learned</div>

      <p>Process problems are usually people problems in disguise — but not in the way you'd expect. The team wasn't
        dysfunctional. The reviews weren't malicious. Everyone was operating rationally within a system that had bad
        incentives baked in.</p>
      <p>The fix wasn't to work harder or add more meetings. It was to change the defaults: what needs to be true before
        work starts, and what happens when feedback arrives outside the window. Small structural changes with clear
        ownership made most of the difference.</p>
