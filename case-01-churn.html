    <div class="cs-section">
      <div class="cs-section-label">The situation</div>

      <p>Our largest enterprise segment had started churning quietly. Not with support tickets or angry emails — just
        silence. Usage would drop off slowly over 60–90 days, and by the time the account reached renewal, the decision
        was already made.</p>
      <p>The retention team flagged it. The CS team had theories. But nobody had a clear answer for <em>why</em>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="cs-section">
      <div class="cs-section-label">My role</div>

      <p>I was brought in as PM to lead the investigation and own the resulting workstream. I partnered with a senior
        designer, two engineers, and our data analyst. No existing spec. No assumed solution.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="cs-section">
      <div class="cs-section-label">Discovery</div>

      <p>I started where I always start: with the data. Our analyst pulled session recordings and funnel drop-off data
        for the segment. The pattern was immediately visible — a specific 4-step workflow had a 34% abandonment rate on
        step 3. Nobody had flagged it because the <em>completion</em> rate still looked okay in aggregate.</p>
      <div class="pullquote">
        <p>"Users weren't confused. They were bored. The workflow made them repeat the same action four times."</p>
      </div>
      <p>We ran 12 JTBD-structured interviews with churned and at-risk customers. The insight that kept coming up: the
        workflow felt designed for an admin, not for the actual user doing the job. Every session required the same
        repetitive input regardless of context.</p>
      <div class="callout">
        <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> The problem wasn't complexity — it was unnecessary repetition. Users had
          developed workarounds (copy-pasting from spreadsheets, keeping the tab open in another window) that added 3+
          minutes per session and left them feeling like the product didn't respect their time.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="cs-section">
      <div class="cs-section-label">The approach</div>

      <p>Rather than redesigning the whole workflow, I scoped the intervention tightly: collapse steps 2–4 into a single
        context-aware step that pre-filled known values. This required a backend change (surfacing user context at the
        right moment) and a frontend change (conditional form logic).</p>
      <div class="cs-list">
        <div class="cs-list-item"><span class="cs-list-n">01</span>
          <div><strong>Defined success metrics upfront.</strong> Primary: workflow completion rate. Secondary:
            time-on-task and 90-day retention for users who touched the feature.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="cs-list-item"><span class="cs-list-n">02</span>
          <div><strong>Wrote a tight spec.</strong> One page. Problem statement, proposed solution, what we're not
            doing, and the rollout plan.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="cs-list-item"><span class="cs-list-n">03</span>
          <div><strong>Ran an A/B test with 20% of affected users</strong> for three weeks before full rollout. Kept the
            old flow as the control.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="cs-list-item"><span class="cs-list-n">04</span>
          <div><strong>Shipped progressively.</strong> New enterprise accounts first, then a phased rollout to existing
            accounts with a comms plan.</div>

          <p class="outcome-desc">Measured at 90 days post-launch for affected accounts.</p>

          <p class="outcome-desc">Average time-on-task dropped from 5.2 to 2.1 minutes.</p>

        <div class="outcome-cell"><span class="outcome-n">94%</span><span class="outcome-l">Completion rate</span>
          <p class="outcome-desc">Up from 66% on the previous workflow.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>The change also had an unexpected secondary effect: support tickets related to this workflow dropped 58% in the
        following quarter. Users weren't confused — they'd just been frustrated.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="cs-section">
      <div class="cs-section-label">What I learned</div>

      <p>The most important lesson here wasn't about the workflow — it was about <strong>where to look</strong>. Churn
        is often a trailing indicator. By the time it shows up in your metrics, the user has already made their
        decision. The signal was buried in session data, not in the renewal conversation.</p>
      <p>This case reinforced my belief that discovery isn't a phase — it's a habit. The team that noticed this pattern
        earliest was the one that had been watching session recordings regularly, not waiting for a problem to be
        escalated.</p>
