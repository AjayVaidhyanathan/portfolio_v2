    <div class="cs-section">
      <div class="cs-section-label">The situation</div>

      <p>Growth in the core markets was healthy but starting to plateau. The leadership team had identified Southeast
        Asia as a potential expansion market — specifically Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines. But "Southeast
        Asia" is not a strategy. The question was: where exactly, for whom, and how?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="cs-section">
      <div class="cs-section-label">My role</div>

      <p>I was asked to lead the market analysis and produce a board-ready recommendation. I worked with an external
        research partner for the in-market interviews and a data analyst for the quantitative sizing work. Timeline: 8
        weeks from kickoff to final presentation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="cs-section">
      <div class="cs-section-label">The framework</div>

      <p>I structured the analysis around three questions that any expansion decision needs to answer:</p>
      <div class="cs-list">
        <div class="cs-list-item"><span class="cs-list-n">01</span>
          <div><strong>Is there a market?</strong> TAM sizing, growth trajectory, digital adoption rates, and comparable
            product penetration in each market.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="cs-list-item"><span class="cs-list-n">02</span>
          <div><strong>Can we win?</strong> Competitive landscape, local incumbents, pricing dynamics, and our
            differentiated positioning in each market.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="cs-list-item"><span class="cs-list-n">03</span>
          <div><strong>At what cost?</strong> Localisation requirements, regulatory considerations, go-to-market model,
            and required headcount.</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="cs-section">
      <div class="cs-section-label">What we found</div>

      <p>The three markets looked very different on paper but had one important thing in common: the primary competitive
        threat wasn't a product — it was habit. Users in all three markets had deeply ingrained workarounds for the
        problem we solve.</p>
      <div class="callout">
        <p><strong>The key insight from interviews:</strong> Price sensitivity was real but not the primary barrier.
          Users were willing to pay if they trusted the product and if the switching cost from their current workaround
          felt justified. That meant our GTM model needed to lead with trust-building, not conversion.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Indonesia emerged as the clearest first market: largest TAM, most developed digital payments infrastructure,
        and the highest existing familiarity with comparable product categories.</p>
      <div class="pullquote">
        <p>"We weren't choosing between three good options. We were choosing which option to prove out first, and
          building the model that makes the next two easier."</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="cs-section">
      <div class="cs-section-label">The recommendation</div>

      <p>A phased approach: Indonesia in Year 1 as the proof-of-concept market, with Vietnam and Philippines gated on
        Year 1 KPIs. Each phase had clear entry criteria, a defined GTM model, and a localisation scope.</p>
      <p>I presented three scenarios (conservative, base, optimistic) with explicit assumptions documented for each. The
        board approved the base case with a Year 1 budget unlocked immediately and Year 2–3 funding contingent on
        hitting Year 1 metrics.</p>

    <div class="cs-section">
      <div class="cs-section-label">What I learned</div>

      <p>Market expansion analyses are often too optimistic because they're built by people who want the answer to be
        yes. I tried to make this one useful by being explicit about what would need to be true for each scenario, and
        by surfacing the risks that could make the conservative case the reality.</p>
      <p>The phased model also matters for a different reason: it gives the company a way to be wrong safely. If
        Indonesia Year 1 underperforms, the gating criteria means we don't overcommit to the next two markets before
        we've learned what we need to learn.</p>
