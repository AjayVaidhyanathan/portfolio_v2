    <div class="cs-section">
      <div class="cs-section-label">The situation</div>

      <p>The app had healthy top-of-funnel numbers. Downloads were strong. Sign-ups were converting at a reasonable
        rate. But the D7 retention curve told a different story — most users who signed up weren't coming back after day
        one.</p>
      <p>The core hypothesis from the growth team: users weren't finding their "aha moment" fast enough. But nobody had
        tested what that moment should be.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="cs-section">
      <div class="cs-section-label">My role</div>

      <p>I was brought in to own the 0→1 feature build from problem definition to launch. Team of 6: myself, 2
        engineers, 1 designer, 1 data analyst, and 1 QA. Timeline: 8 weeks to an MVP that we could measure against.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="cs-section">
      <div class="cs-section-label">Discovery</div>

      <p>I started with cohort analysis. Users who returned on Day 7 had one behaviour in common in their first session:
        they'd completed a specific personalisation step that the majority of users skipped. The skip rate was 73%.</p>
      <p>Qualitative interviews confirmed it — users who skipped it didn't understand why it mattered. The step felt
        optional and abstract. For users who completed it, the app immediately felt relevant to them.</p>
      <div class="callout">
        <p><strong>The insight:</strong> The aha moment already existed in the product. The problem was that we were
          making it too easy to skip. The solution wasn't to build something new — it was to make the existing value
          unavoidable.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="cs-section">
      <div class="cs-section-label">What we built</div>

      <p>A personalisation feature that surfaced during onboarding and made the app's value proposition immediately
        personal. Key design decisions:</p>
      <div class="cs-list">
        <div class="cs-list-item"><span class="cs-list-n">01</span>
          <div><strong>Made it feel like setup, not a survey.</strong> Every question had an immediate visible effect on
            the app. You could see it adapting in real time.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="cs-list-item"><span class="cs-list-n">02</span>
          <div><strong>Set a clear completion signal.</strong> Users knew exactly how many steps remained and what
            they'd unlock by finishing.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="cs-list-item"><span class="cs-list-n">03</span>
          <div><strong>Made skipping harder, not impossible.</strong> You could still skip, but it required an active
            choice rather than a passive scroll-past.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="cs-list-item"><span class="cs-list-n">04</span>
          <div><strong>Preserved the data.</strong> Personalisation choices carried through the entire app experience,
            so the effort felt worth it.</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

      <p>8 weeks is tight for a 0→1 feature. I kept scope ruthlessly narrow: we were solving one problem (low
        personalisation completion during onboarding) and measuring one thing (D7 retention for users who completed the
        new flow vs. those who didn't).</p>
      <p>We ran a 3-week beta with 15% of new sign-ups before full rollout. The D7 retention lift was significant enough
        to justify full release within the original timeline.</p>

      <p>The most common 0→1 mistake is building something new when the value you need is already there. In this case,
        the aha moment existed — we just weren't surfacing it well. Discovery before building saved us from building the
        wrong thing.</p>
      <p>Keeping scope narrow also mattered. An 8-week timeline forces good prioritisation. We cut three ideas that were
        interesting but not essential, and the feature is better for it.</p>
