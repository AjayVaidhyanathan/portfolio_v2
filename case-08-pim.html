            <div class="cs-section-label">The client</div>
            <p>PrecisionSense GmbH is a fictional industrial sensor manufacturer based in Germany with 8-figure ARR.
                Their
                product portfolio spans 600 base products and 3,000+ SKUs, serving four highly regulated sectors:
                automotive EV
                battery monitoring, medical diagnostic equipment, renewable energy pitch control systems, and ruggedized
                aerospace sensors.</p>
            <p>In each of these sectors, an incorrect technical specification is not a customer service problem - it is
                a
                legal and safety liability. The stakes around data accuracy were unusually high.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="cs-section">
            <div class="cs-section-label">The situation</div>
            <p>PrecisionSense relied on their ERP system for transactional data: pricing, inventory, and orders. But ERP
                was
                never designed to carry descriptive technical data, compliance certifications, or marketing assets. The
                gap
                between what ERP could store and what customers actually needed had been filled entirely by manual human
                effort.

                    <p class="pain-desc">Variants managed in rigid ERP tables that had no concept of parent-child

            <div class="pullquote">
                <p>"The ERP knows what we sell and how much we have. It has no idea what the product actually is, what
                    it does,
                    or whether it is certified for use in a medical device."</p>
            </div>

            <p>The deeper issue was that product data lived in three separate systems that never talked to each other:
                engineering data in a PLM system, transactional data in the ERP, and commercial data in spreadsheets and
                email.
                Every customer-facing output - datasheets, portal listings, catalog entries - required someone to
                manually
                reconcile all three. That person had become a critical single point of failure.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="cs-section">
            <div class="cs-section-label">Why custom, not off-the-shelf</div>
            <p>Before scoping a custom build, I evaluated three established SaaS PIM platforms. All three failed on
                requirements that were non-negotiable for PrecisionSense.</p>

            <div class="cs-list">
                <div class="cs-list-item">
                    <span class="cs-list-n">01</span>
                    <div><strong>Pricing at scale.</strong> Standard SaaS PIMs charge per SKU. At 3,000+ SKUs with a
                        roadmap to
                        10,000+, the annual licensing cost exceeded the custom build cost within 18 months. The client
                        would have
                        been paying more to use worse software.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="cs-list-item">
                    <span class="cs-list-n">02</span>
                    <div><strong>Workflow rigidity.</strong> Compliance approval flows in medical and aerospace contexts
                        require
                        custom logic: multi-tier sign-off, external partner review stages, and product-type-specific
                        validation
                        rules. No off-the-shelf tool supported this without expensive professional services that
                        reintroduced the
                        vendor dependency we were trying to escape.</div>

                        Standard
                        connectors offered shallow, one-way sync. The business required real-time bidirectional data
                        flow between
                        ERP, PLM, and the new PIM. Only a custom API layer could deliver this reliably.</div>

                    <div><strong>Data sovereignty.</strong> Storing mission-critical technical specs and compliance
                        documents on a
                        third-party SaaS platform was not acceptable to the client's legal team. A self-hosted custom
                        system gave
                        them complete control over their intellectual property.</div>

        <div class="cs-section">
            <div class="cs-section-label">My role</div>
            <p>I led product definition end-to-end: translating the client's operational pain into a functional spec,
                making
                the build-vs-buy decision, defining the technical architecture priorities, scoping each feature against
                the core
                use cases, and owning the delivery timeline in partnership with the engineering team.</p>
            <p>The architecture philosophy I set from the start was "vanilla first" - minimal external dependencies,
                prioritizing auditability and long-term maintainability over feature richness. For a lean industrial
                team with
                no dedicated software ops function, a system that is easy to understand and secure is more valuable than
                one
                that is feature-complete but opaque.</p>

        <div class="cs-section">
            <div class="cs-section-label">What I learned</div>
            <p>The most important decision on this project was made before any code was written: choosing to build
                custom
                rather than configure off-the-shelf. That decision required a structured business case comparing 3-year
                TCO
                across options, not just a feature checklist. The custom build was cheaper at scale, more compliant by
                design,
                and ultimately more aligned with the client's risk profile than any SaaS alternative.</p>
            <p>The "vanilla architecture" principle was also a product decision, not just a technical one. When you are
                building for a team that has no dedicated software operations function, the ongoing cost of complexity
                is real
                and ongoing. A system with fewer dependencies is easier to audit, easier to hand over, and easier to
                modify two
                years later when the original engineers are gone. Simplicity has a business value that rarely appears in
                a
                feature comparison.</p>
            <p>The hardest conversation on this project was telling the client that one of their three top-priority
                features
                needed to move to phase two. The compliance approval workflow had scope that would have pushed the
                initial
                delivery by six weeks. Cutting it from v1 and shipping the core PIM on time - with a committed roadmap
                for the
                approval module - was the right call. The team had the data benefit within their original timeline, and
                the
                approval module shipped eight weeks later with better specification because we had real usage data to
                inform it
                by then.</p>
