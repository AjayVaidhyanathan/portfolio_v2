    <div class="cs-section">
      <div class="cs-section-label">The situation</div>

      <p>The growth team had been running pricing experiments for a quarter. They'd tried discounting, free trial
        extensions, and urgency messaging. Nothing moved the needle meaningfully. Trial conversion sat at 8% and felt
        stuck.</p>
      <p>I was asked to take a fresh look at the problem before the team ran another experiment.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="cs-section">
      <div class="cs-section-label">What I found</div>

      <p>I started with heatmaps and session recordings, not hypotheses. The pattern was clear: users spent most of
        their time on the pricing page not comparing plans — they were re-reading the feature list, scrolling back up to
        the headline, and then leaving without converting.</p>
      <p>That told me the problem wasn't decision fatigue or price sensitivity. It was uncertainty. Users weren't sure
        what they'd actually get.</p>
      <div class="callout">
        <p><strong>In 14 user interviews, the most common phrase was some version of: "I'm not sure if this is worth it
            for me specifically."</strong> Not "it's too expensive." Not "I need more time." Just genuine uncertainty
          about fit.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="cs-section">
      <div class="cs-section-label">The insight</div>

      <p>Our pricing page was written for a feature comparison. It answered "what does each plan include?" but not "what
        will change for you if you upgrade?" Those are very different questions.</p>
      <div class="pullquote">
        <p>"Users needed to see themselves using the product — not a grid of features they'd have to mentally translate
          into their own context."</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="cs-section">
      <div class="cs-section-label">What we changed</div>

      <div class="cs-list">
        <div class="cs-list-item"><span class="cs-list-n">01</span>
          <div><strong>Reframed the headline.</strong> From a feature-led statement to an outcome-led one. Specific to
            the user's most common job-to-be-done.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="cs-list-item"><span class="cs-list-n">02</span>
          <div><strong>Replaced the feature grid with use-case scenarios.</strong> Three short scenarios (by role and
            goal) that made the value concrete and personal.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="cs-list-item"><span class="cs-list-n">03</span>
          <div><strong>Added social proof at the point of decision.</strong> A single testimonial per plan, selected to
            match the profile of the most common trial user in that tier.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="cs-list-item"><span class="cs-list-n">04</span>
          <div><strong>Simplified the CTA.</strong> From three buttons with different labels to one consistent CTA with
            a clearer trial promise.</div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>We changed nothing about the price, the plan structure, or what was included. This was purely a communication
        change.</p>

      <div class="cs-section-label">What I learned</div>

      <p>The best growth interventions often aren't growth interventions at all — they're clarity interventions. When
        users don't convert, the instinct is to make the offer more attractive. Sometimes the offer is already
        attractive; you just haven't communicated why yet.</p>
      <p>Starting with session recordings rather than a hypothesis backlog was the right call. The data showed me where
        users were struggling before I had a chance to assume I knew what the problem was.</p>
