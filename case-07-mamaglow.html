    <!-- Situation -->
    <div class="cs-section">
      <div class="cs-section-label">The situation</div>
      <p>After two years of strong ARR growth, the business had hit structural limits. The influencer pool in DACH and
        France was saturated - not because of spend efficiency, but because every reachable person had already been
        reached. LTV of €60 per customer looked healthy until you accounted for the 18-24 month realization window,
        which created a cash timing problem the unit economics alone couldn't solve.</p>
      <p>Revenue was concentrated in a few top products and a few top influencers. That engine was decelerating.</p>
      <div class="callout">
        <p><strong>The core insight from the portfolio matrix:</strong> Omega-3 sat in the "Essentials" quadrant - high
          repeat, stable revenue, but low differentiation and low margin. The "Complex Heroes" quadrant
          (multi-ingredient, premium, high LTV) had clear vacancies. The strategic question was: which Complex Hero to
          build next, and what ingredient platform could anchor it?</p>
      </div>
      <p>I stress-tested every alternative before arriving at a new product recommendation: geographic expansion
        required a 12-18 month minimum runway before meaningful revenue; increased ad spend faced diminishing returns on
        a tapped audience; retention-only optimization is defensive, not a growth lever. A new product was the only
        lever that simultaneously created a new reason to buy, unlocked cross-sell, reached new audiences, and opened a
        new influencer category.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- The platform thesis -->
    <div class="cs-section">
      <div class="cs-section-label">The platform thesis</div>
      <p>The existing fish oil Omega-3 SKU was selling as a commodity ingredient. The strategic repositioning was to
        treat Omega-3 - specifically algae-sourced DHA and EPA - as an ingredient platform that could anchor premium
        complex products at each major life stage.</p>
      <p>Algae-sourced DHA had two properties that made this viable: it eliminates the fishy taste barrier (the most
        cited reason for Omega-3 non-compliance), and it is inherently vegan, which opens a meaningfully underserved
        segment. In a market where competitors offered fish oil capsules or vegan capsules, a premium vegan gummy
        complex had no direct competition.</p>

      <div class="pullquote">
        <p>"Omega-3 is not a product. It is an ingredient that follows a person through every stage of their life -
          pregnancy, postpartum recovery, childhood development. We were selling it as a one-size product to everyone
          and capturing none of that specificity."</p>
      </div>

      <p>The platform structure across the portfolio:</p>
      <div class="platform-wrap">

        <div class="platform-row">
          <div class="platform-cat">Complex Heroes</div>
          <div class="platform-products">

      </div>
      <p>Each new product uses algae DHA as the anchor ingredient, then adds clinically relevant co-ingredients for the
        specific life stage. The result is a product family that a single customer can move through over 5+ years - at
        zero incremental CAC per transition.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Evidence -->
    <div class="cs-section">
      <div class="cs-section-label">The evidence</div>
      <p>The recommendation was built on three independent data sources that all pointed to the same gap, from three
        different angles.</p>
      <div class="evidence-grid">
        <div class="ev-card">

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>The churn data added urgency. Women aged 28-35 were churning at <strong>34% above the average rate</strong> -
        not because of product dissatisfaction, but because pregnancy forced them to stop taking existing products and
        look elsewhere. The portfolio had no answer for that life-stage transition. Every churning customer in that
        demographic was a retention failure caused entirely by a product gap.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="cs-section">
      <div class="cs-section-label">The product concepts</div>
      <p>Three products, designed as a connected ecosystem rather than standalone SKUs. Each one is a Complex Hero by

      <p>The market opportunity was sized bottom-up from consumption data in DACH, with Italy as a secondary entry
        market. The competitive gap analysis on Amazon confirmed the niche was real and unoccupied at the premium vegan
        gummy positioning.</p>

      <p>A targeted competitive search confirmed the gap: "premium vegan prenatal omega-3 gummy Germany" returned 18
        fish oil capsule results (not vegan), 6 vegan capsule products (not easy to digest), and 4 gummy prenatals using
        fish oil. Zero premium vegan gummy competitors at the Complex Hero positioning we proposed.</p>

    <!-- LTV case -->
    <div class="cs-section">
      <div class="cs-section-label">The LTV case</div>
      <p>The business case was structured around three specific problems the platform solved simultaneously, not just
        revenue opportunity.</p>
      <div class="cs-list">
        <div class="cs-list-item">
          <span class="cs-list-n">01</span>
          <div><strong>Churn conversion.</strong> Women 28-35 churned at 34% above average due to a pregnancy-stage
            portfolio gap. MamaGlow converts that churn trigger into a product fit - retaining the highest-intent cohort
            at exactly the moment they leave.</div>

    <!-- Reflection -->
    <div class="cs-section">
      <div class="cs-section-label">What I learned</div>
      <p>The most important reframe in this project was moving from "new product" to "ingredient platform." Proposing
        four new SKUs sounds like a large investment. Proposing a single algae DHA platform that unlocks four product
        positions across a 5-year customer lifecycle sounds like infrastructure. The same recommendation reads very
        differently depending on which lens you use to present it.</p>
      <p>The three-source evidence structure was also deliberate. Any one data point - internal search queries, customer
        feedback, or Amazon data - can be dismissed as anecdotal. All three independently pointing to the same gap made
        the case much harder to argue against in a board setting. Evidence that arrives from multiple directions at the
        same conclusion carries significantly more weight than a single strong signal.</p>
      <p>Starting with the churn data was the right entry point. The 34% above-average churn rate in the 28-35 female
        cohort reframed the entire conversation: this was not just a new product opportunity, it was an existing
        retention failure with an available fix.</p>
